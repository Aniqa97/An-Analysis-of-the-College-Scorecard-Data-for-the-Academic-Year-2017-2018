# An-Analysis-of-the-College-Scorecard-Data-for-the-Academic-Year-2017-2018





I will be analysing US Postsecondary Education System data from the year 2017-2018. This data was collected under the College Scoreboard Project by the U.S Department of Education.
The Dataset can be found here: https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/

I will be analysing the Dataset to answer the following questions:

1. How are the instituitions spread across the US? i.e which state has the most instituitons. 

2. Which states have the most institutions?

3. How is the governance structure distributed ?

4.  What is the distribution of the highest awards granted by the institutions?

5.  What is the distribution of the predominant awards granted by the institutions?

6. How much net revenue on average do public and private schools generate per student?

7. How is an instution's Net Tuition Fee per Full Time Student correlated to its admission rate?

8. Finally we will use ML to see if a student's application will be accepted or not.
